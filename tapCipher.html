    <h4 class="headings"> Current Usage </h4> The usage of the above code uses a "/" as the pause between grid references and a "-" to differenciate between words.
    <br> There is also a space between words
    <h3 class="headings"> The cipher </h3> Tap Cipher, or Knock Code, is a way to encode text messages in a simple way.
    <br /> The tap code was often used by prisoners by banging metal bars or pipes against the wall.
    <br /> Each letter is sent via tapping two numbers. The first telling us the row and the second telling us the column.
    <br /> for example to "tap" the letter B the prisoner would tap once, pause then tap twice.
    <br /> When you use this code in the real world, the letter "x" would be used to represent a new sentence
    <br /> and the letter "k" to represent acknolwedgements
    <h4 class="headings"> Design </h4> The code is designed based on a Polybius Square, wich is a 5x5 grid of letters.
    <br /> Each character in the latin alphabet is represented except from "k" which shares it's spot with "c"
    <br /> The message is sent via taps or knock sounds against the wall.
    <h4 class="headings"> The need for the code </h4> The tap code is most often used by prisoners over morse code due to the complexity of morse code.
    <br /> For the prisoner the use of morse code causes s difficulty as it required two seperate sounds.
    <br /> a "dot" and a "dash". Tap code is just a dot.
    <br /> Further a morse code novice also would probably require a cheat sheet until they have learned the code
