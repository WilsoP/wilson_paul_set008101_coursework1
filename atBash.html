    <h4 class="headings" > Usage </h4> The atBash cipher is used by switching characters for the reverse in the alphabet
    <h4 class="headings">The atbash cipher is another substitution Cipher </h4> The cipher was origionally used to encode the hebrew alphabet
    <br /> however it can be modified to be used with any simple language.
    <br />
    <br /> The cipher is known as a monoalphabetic cipher, to encode you simple take the alphabet
    <br /> and swich each character with the reverse in the alphabet. So "a" would become "z"
    <br /> and "z" would become "a".
    <br />
    <br /> Due to it's simplicity the cipher has 0 communications security.
    <h4 class="headings"> The History </h4> The name comes from the hebrew language, and follows the encoding style.
    <br /> It takes the first, last, second then second last Hebrew letters,
    <br /> (Aleph-Tav-Beth-Shin) which loosely managed to come out at atBash.
    <br />
    <br /> There is many refernces to atBash in the bible, multiple times people have
    <br /> used atbash to cover up city names.
    <br /> This is done in "Jeremiah 51:1 - 'Behold, I will raise up against babylon, and against the inhabitants of Lev-kamai'"
    <br /> - Lev-kamai meaning Chaldeans after atbash is applied
