      Caesars Cipher, also known as Caesars Shift, Shift Cipher or Caesars Code,
      </br>
      is one of the most well known encrytion methods. It is a "plain text" substituion Cipher
      <br /> it works by shifting letters along the alphabet by a user inputted step amount.
      <br />
      <br /> It is unknown how successfull the cipher actually was at the time however currently the cipher has no communication security
      <br />
      <br /> The cipher is named such as it was recorded first being used by the Roman Empiror Julius Caesar.
      <br />
      <br /> The cipher has been used to create children's toy made out of 2 rotating disks to encypt and decrypt the code
      <br />
      <br /> Although a basic cipher it was still being used in 1915 by the Russian army.
      <br /> You could say, they are not russian' around to get new encryption methods.
